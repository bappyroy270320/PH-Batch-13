<p>Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high <storong>journalism</storong> quality, and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record. With the popularity of the Internet, many newspapers are now digital, with their news presented online as the main medium that most of the readers use, with the print edition being secondary (for the minority of customers that choose to pay for it) or, in some cases, retired. The decline of newspapers in the early 21st century was at first largely interpreted as a mere print-versus-digital contest in which digital beats print. The reality is different and multivariate, as newspapers now routinely have online presence; <h3>anyone willing to subscribe</h3> can read them digitally online. Factors such as classified ads no longer being a large revenue center (because of other ways to buy and sell online) and ad impressions now being dispersed across many media are inputs.</p>
